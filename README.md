# ðŸŽ¯Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Before deploying a project, conducting a thorough requirement analysis is essential to gain a clear understanding of what the system will do and how it will perform.
    
## What is Requirement Analysis?
   
Required Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering and defining the needs and expectation of stakeholders for a software product to be developed and how it will 
perform.It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of software development.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
  
-  Helps avoid misunderstandings or missed features
-  Facilitate accurate estimation of project cost and resources
-  Quality assurance that it meets the finla product specifications
-  Providing a solid foundation for designing and developing the system

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
| Key Activities| Description|
|---------------|-----------------------|
|Requirement Gathering|Information is collected from stakeholders about what they expect from the system. The goal is to identify all potential requirements|
|Requirement Elicitation|it involves actively engaging in brainstorming session to generate ideas and creating prototype to visualize the system product |
|Requirement Documentation| Creating a document that will make everyone understand whatthe system should do and writing a user story to describe the fuctinality|  
|Requirement Analysis and Modeling|requirements are examined for clarity, feasibility and completeness.Modeling helps represent these requirements visually or structurally.| 
|Requirement Validation|Presenting the document to the stakeholder to make sure it aligns with their requirements and they are realistic and achievable| 

## Types of Requirements
|Functional Requirements|Non-functional Requirements|
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Focuses on what the system should do example:Property Research,User Registration and user Authentification|Focuses on how the system performs examaple Perfomance,security,Scalability,usabolity and realaibility|

## Use Case Diagrams
#### what Use Case Diagrams?         
- Its a visualized presentation of interaction between users and the system.
 #### Use Case Diagrams benefits
- Provide a clear visualization presentation of the system.
- Help identitying and organizing system requirements.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development teams.

## Acceptance Criteria
 #### Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- Helps developers, testers, and stakeholders understand exactly what the feature should do
- Ensures that the delivered feature meets the intended requirements.
- Facilitates collaboration between product owners, developers, and testers
- Helps developers focus on delivering the right functionality without scope creep
- Helps ensure that the end product meets user needs by capturing essential requirements.
